        <p>Bushidō (武士道, "the way of the warrior") is a moral code concerning samurai attitudes, behavior and lifestyle, formalized in the Edo period. There are multiple types of bushido which evolved significantly through history. Contemporary forms of bushido are still used in the social and economic organization of Japan. Bushido is also used as an overarching term for all the codes, practices, philosophies and principles of samurai culture. It is loosely analogous to the European concept of chivalry, but there are major differences.</p>
        <p>Here are the eight virtues of Bushido as defined by Nitobe Inazō:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Righteousness (義, gi):</strong> Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice, and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Heroic Courage (勇, yū):</strong> Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully, and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Benevolence, Compassion (仁, jin):</strong> Through intense training and hard work, the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Respect (礼, rei):</strong> True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Honesty (誠, makoto):</strong> When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to 'give their word'. They do not have to 'promise'. Speaking and doing are the same action.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Honour (名誉, meiyo):</strong> Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of who they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Duty and Loyalty (忠義, chūgi):</strong> Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Self-Control (自制, jisei):</strong> Self-control is essential for warriors. It helps them maintain discipline and composure in all situations, ensuring that their actions are deliberate and well-considered.</li>
            </ol>
