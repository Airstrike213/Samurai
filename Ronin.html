        <h1>The Ronin</h1>
        <br>
        <p>In feudal Japan (1185–1868), a rōnin (Japanese: 浪人, IPA: [ɾoːɲiɴ], 'drifter' or 'wanderer', lit. 'a person of the waves') was a type of samurai who had no lord or master and in some cases, had also severed all links with his family or clan. A samurai becomes a rōnin upon the death of his master, or after the loss of his master's favor or legal privilege. In modern Japanese usage, usually the term is used to describe a salaryman who is unemployed or a secondary school graduate who has not yet been admitted to university.</p>
